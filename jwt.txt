JWt stands for JSON WEB TOKEN, it is an open public platform used to share security information between a client and a server Each JWT contain encoded objects,
Jwt are design using such an algorithm that if a token which we have is manipulated it became invalid for the current user. 
And also the the token which we received are in the JSON format. JSON is divided in three words a header, payload, and signature.



						Top 3 benefits of JWT1.Secirity
1.Secirity
Any one could not update or alter any detail of a particular user without the Jwt token

2. Validity
In JWT one can ensure thetime for their token for eg if  the user has keep the time 5. minutes so after 5 minutes if token
goes to any malicious  hand also but it will be of no use as the time for the token hass been expire

3.Information Exchange: JWTs are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties because they can be signed, 
which means you can be sure that the senders are who they say they are. Additionally, the structure of a JWT allows you to verify that the content hasn't 
been tampered with.
